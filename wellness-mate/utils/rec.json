Add the chilli sauce, ketchup, rice vinegar, honey and 90ml water, then whisk again and set aside. Drain most of the excess oil from the pan and return to a medium heat. Fry the ginger, garlic and chopped chilli for a few minutes until fragrant. Stir in the chilli powder, onion and pepper, turning up the heat to medium-high, and fry until lightly browned. Tip in the soy sauce mixture bubble until thickened slightly.",
      "Remove from the heat and stir in the paneer, ensuring it\u2019s well-coated in the sauce. Add a splash more water if needed, and season to taste. Sprinkle over the spring onion and serve with rice, if you like."

When it is boiling rapidly, tip in the pasta with a generous sprinkling of salt. Give it a stir, return to the boil and cook for 6 minutes. Add the broccoli, then return the water to the boil and cook for 4 minutes more, until the broccoli is on the firm side of just tender. Drain well.",
      "While the pasta is cooking, put the butter, flour and milk in a large pan and heat, whisking or stirring continuously, until it thickens to make a smooth sauce. Remove from the heat and stir in the mascarpone, sun-dried tomatoes, capers (if using), anchovies (if using) and basil, then add the pasta and broccoli and season well.",
      "Halve the salmon fillets widthways (you will see that there is an obvious divide on each fillet) then place the pieces in a single layer on the base of the ovenproof dish. Spoon the broccoli mixture on top, then scatter with the grated cheddar. (You can chill this for up to 4 hours if you want to get ahead.)",
